## Synopsis

A web application that shows departing public transport vehicles from nearby stops. The app shows departures that leave within one hour and at range of less than 1km from the user location. 
The app works in Helsinki metropolitan area in Finland. No geolocation test version shows a fixed location in Helsinki. 
The app uses device geolocation and open data from digitransit.fi GraphQL routing api (info about stops, vehicles, departures etc).
The app was made with HTML5, CSS3, JS, jQuery, Bootstrap3.

## Motivation

I needed a phone app that shows nearest public transport departures without clicking any buttons or typing any addresses. I also wanted to learn how to use the open GraphQL data.

## Installation

The app can be seen in
https://masd925.github.io/DepartureApp/               (Only works if you use it in Helsinki metropolitan area in Finland)
https://masd925.github.io/DepartureAppNoGeolocation/  (Works everywhere, because it uses a fixed location in Helsinki)
